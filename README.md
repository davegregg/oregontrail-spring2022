# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: KEY TERMS

# Abstraction
  + Describing something else in a simpler or more flexible way.
  + Indirection: Indirectly dealing with something, in the hopes of simplifying how we work with it, or working with it more flexibly, or without it having to be present.

# Encapsulation
  + en-capsule: "putting something in a capsule/container and the benefits we get from it"
    - Grouping things together
    - You know where to find those things
    - You can make it more secure
  + Encapsulation is bundling data together, perhaps along with tools for working with that data, protecting the data from being accessed or changed unexpectedly.

# Polymorphism
  + "poly-": multiple or many
  + "-morph-": change or variation or shape
  + Same command/message, possibly different results
  + Telling kids "It is time to go home": they may go to different places, by different means, but they all know to respond/react to the same message.
  + Telling animals to "speak"

# Inheritance
  + Inheritance is a particular example of polymorphism in class systems, where you create a "Parent Class" (or, "Superclass") and one or more "Child Classes" (or, "Subclasses"). A child class should *inherit* the features of its parent class. And if the parent class itself has a parent class, then our child class should inherit the features of both parent classes.
  + Examples:
    + User Class
      + TrialUser Class
      + ContractorUser Class
      + ModeratorUser Class
        + AdminUser Class
          + SuperAdminUser Class
            + new SuperAdminUser()
